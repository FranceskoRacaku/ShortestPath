# 04- Final Project: ShortestPath
This project will create a program which will ask the user to enter two states in USA and it will find the shortest path to get there. The idea of doing this project is by creating a graph of cities in the Unites States with link to the other cities. Each city wil be used as a vertex in the graph and each link between cities will be an edge in the graph. The cities with their corresponding parameters will be read from a CSV data file.

# Project Overview
This project is a good choice in getting familiar how the google map, maps or other programs make it possible to find the fastest way to get to the required destination. Also more practice using JAVA. The output of this project should be something like: It will ask the user to put the name of a city, which will be the starting point, and then it will ask the name of second city which will be the destination.

# Vision statement
This project is going to be useful for any person who travels short or long distances and wants to find the shortest and quickest way to get to it. It could be used by any customer at age 12 or older. The ShortestPath is a software which allows the user to input their starting point and their destination and it will calculate which direction the user will have to go to arrive at his destination as soon as possible. Unlike other maps software, our software only finds the shortest path between two cities at a moment.

- Ella, age 21, a junior statistics major at a private university in New York City. Born and raised in New Jersey, her mother is a chemistry professor and father a commercial pilot for a major airliner. Inspired at a young age by her parents to pursue a field in mathematics, she was twice captain of her highschool's mathletes and student president during her senior year, allowing her to get into a great school 
with a healthy scholarship. Her day-day involves going to classes, studying, and tutoring math on the weekends at both the university and the local highschools. During her free time, she watches films and maintains a log of data for every film. After graduation, she plans on going to grad school, with plans of becoming a professor in the field of mathematics or statistics. 
- One of her classes is driven on generation and analysis of some data. Her current assignment provides her with general data for all airports and flights in USA from major cities. Pick a city that has more than one 
airport (ex. NYC, LA, Boston, etc...) and generate the earliest arrival time (have access to departure time) for all major cities starting from each airport in origin city, and analyze in some statistical way. This application 
will allow her to generate data she needs, without having to calculate the distance by hand, or writing her own program to do so.
